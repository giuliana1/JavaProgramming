Polymorphism (Many forms): Ability of the objects to take on many forms
			  "IS A relation" is a must

			  Reference type is parent class/interface, and object type is child class

			  Reference type decides what can be accessed/called

			  Object type decides which implementation to execute

			    WebDriver driver = new FireFoxDriver();
		  		driver.takeScreenShot();

			  Animal animal = new Tiger();

			  Employee employee = new Developer();
